## AppImage with some googies

Uses script `refresh-kruciai` that compiles goodies like
 [elinks](https://github.com/rkd77/elinks ),
 [qjs and qjsc](https://github.com/quickjs-ng/quickjs )
 into one AppImage file.

It can be compiled with [chawan](https://git.sr.ht/~bptato/chawan ),
by `refresh-kruciai --with-chawan`, and run as `AIM=cha ./$APPIMAGENAME`

For more information run `./$APPIMAGENAME help`
